            <h3>Method</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
                <li>Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.</li>
                <li>Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly ali 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.</li>
                <li>Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through. Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.</li>
                <li>Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.</li>
            </ol>
